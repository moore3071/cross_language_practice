#Java

##Classes, so many classes
***
Java is an object oriented programming language that is composed of .java files which detail classes. Good introduction language for new programmers (IMHO). It has the great advantage of runnning with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which means it can run on any machine that has the JVM implemented.

##Using it
Java can be quite annoying on the command line. javac is the java compiler tool, then the command java must be used to run the program with the class file name as an argument sans the file extension.
