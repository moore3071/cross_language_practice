##Classes, so many classes

Java is an object oriented programming language that is composed of .java files which detail classes. Good introduction language for new programmers (IMHO). It has the great advantage of runnning with the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which means it can run on any machine that has the JVM implemented.
