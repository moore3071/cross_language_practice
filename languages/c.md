#C
##The heavy lifter of the Unix world
***
C is an old language on which all Unix-based systems that I can think of are made from. C came from Bell labs and was used to re-implement Unix after the original assembly implementation. C is found all over the grid and has spawned many variants (C++, C#, etc.). IMHO it is one of the languages that you at least need some experience in.
